# Two to Four - Endpoints


**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Mini Challenge Scope:** Design an API with 3 endpoints. Each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside the Controller folder.
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder.

Endpoints:
1. endpoint where you ask the user to enter 2 numbers.  Once you have the 2 numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence.
     - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

2. endpoint where you ask 2 questions. You will take the answer from those questions and display the answer in one sentence.
     - What is your name? 
     - What time did you wake up?
     *Your output should be a sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up

3. endpoint where you ask you will ask the user to enter in two numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements:
     I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number.
     II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.

**Comment(s):**

The application works perfectly as intended. When I tested to do all 3 of them they all return the right response on both swagger and postman. Overall I would like to say it works and she did a good job on this minichallenge project.
